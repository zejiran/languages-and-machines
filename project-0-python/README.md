# Project 0

Simple robot language parser made by Juan Alegría - 202011282.

## Usage

First, the `./samples` folder must be filled with `.txt` input files to be tested.

For each file found in the folder, the program will read their commands and definitions for then showing an output that
validates if the syntax is correct or not.

Example output: `Is Input N using a correct syntax? | YES`
